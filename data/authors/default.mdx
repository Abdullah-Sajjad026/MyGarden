As an experienced and highly skilled full-stack developer, I am adept in all stages of
web development and focused on crafting exceptional user experiences. With
expertise in the development and maintenance of web systems, I bring a diverse and
promising skill set to any project.  

I am proficient in various technologies, including Next.js, React.js, TypeScript,
Node.js, Express.js and have a strong ability to learn new technologies quickly. I am a
team player who can also effectively self-manage during independent projects and
am dedicated to delivering high-quality work that exceeds client expectations.  

With a passion for staying up to date with the latest industry trends and continuously
improving my skills, I possess a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset that
enables me to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions.  

I also like playing videos games with a more interest in shooting games. Some of my liked games are Call of Duty, PUBGM and other classics like Subway Surfers etc.
